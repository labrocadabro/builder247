# Project Architecture

This document describes the high-level architecture of the AI Implementation Agent project.

## Overview

The project implements an AI-powered coding assistant that can automatically implement todo items in a codebase. It uses the Claude 3 Opus model for code generation and modification, with a robust set of tools for executing commands, managing files, and ensuring security.

## Core Components

### 1. Implementation Agent (`src/agent.py`)

The central coordinator that manages the implementation workflow:

- Handles high-level todo implementation logic
- Coordinates between AI model and tools
- Manages retry logic for failed operations
- Provides logging and error handling

Key classes:

- `AgentConfig`: Configuration container for agent settings and security policies
- `ImplementationAgent`: Main implementation logic

### 2. Anthropic Client (`src/client.py`)

Manages communication with the Claude API:

- Handles message formatting and token management
- Maintains conversation history
- Processes tool calls from the model
- Implements conversation persistence

Key classes:

- `AnthropicClient`: Main API client
- `ConversationWindow`: Token limit management
- `Message`: Message representation
- `ConversationHistoryManager`: History persistence

### 3. Tool System (`src/tools/`)

Provides a set of safe operations for the AI to interact with the system:

#### Command Execution (`src/tools/command.py`)

- Safe command execution with security checks
- Environment variable protection
- Piped command support
- Output sanitization

#### File System Tools (`src/tools/filesystem.py`)

- Safe file operations
- Path validation
- Workspace restrictions
- Permission management

#### Tool Implementations (`src/tools/implementations.py`)

- High-level tool registry
- Tool execution coordination
- Error handling and retries
- Security policy enforcement

### 4. Security (`src/security/`)

Manages security constraints and resource protection:

#### Core Security (`src/security/core.py`)

- Path access control
- Command restrictions
- Environment variable protection
- Output sanitization

#### Environment Protection (`src/security/environment_protection.py`)

- Protected variable management
- Environment sanitization
- Dockerfile variable loading

### 5. Utilities (`src/utils/`)

Common utilities and helper functions:

#### Monitoring (`src/utils/monitoring.py`)

- Structured logging
- Operation tracking
- Error logging

#### Retry Logic (`src/utils/retry.py`)

- Error recovery
- Retry policies
- Cleanup handling

## Data Flow

1. User Input

   ```
   User -> ImplementationAgent
        -> Todo item + Acceptance criteria
   ```

2. Implementation Process

   ```
   ImplementationAgent -> AnthropicClient
                      -> Model generates plan
                      -> Tool calls
                      -> File/system modifications
                      -> Test execution
   ```

3. Security Checks

   ```
   Tools -> SecurityContext
        -> Path validation
        -> Command restrictions
        -> Environment protection
        -> Output sanitization
   ```

4. History Management
   ```
   AnthropicClient -> ConversationHistoryManager
                   -> SQLite storage
                   -> Token management
   ```

## Security Architecture

### 1. Path Security

- Workspace directory isolation
- Allowed paths configuration
- Path traversal prevention
- Symlink protection

### 2. Command Security

- Restricted command list
- Command injection prevention
- Environment variable isolation
- Output sanitization

### 3. Environment Protection

- Allowed environment variables
- Variable value sanitization
- Protected variable list
- Environment isolation

### 4. File Operations

- Size limits
- Permission checks
- Content validation
- Safe file handling

### 5. Error Handling

- Secure error messages
- Resource cleanup
- Retry policies
- Failure isolation

## Testing Architecture

The project uses pytest for testing with several test categories:

### 1. Unit Tests

- Individual component testing
- Mocked dependencies
- Security validation
- Error handling

### 2. Integration Tests

- Component interaction testing
- Tool system validation
- Security integration
- History management

### 3. End-to-End Tests

- Complete workflow testing
- Real API integration
- File system operations
- Command execution

## Error Handling

The project implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

1. **Retry Logic**

   - Configurable retry attempts
   - Exponential backoff
   - Cleanup between retries

2. **Error Propagation**

   - Structured error responses
   - Detailed error context
   - Error logging

3. **Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Cleanup procedures
   - State restoration
   - Resource cleanup

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**

   - Parallel tool execution
   - Distributed operation support
   - Resource pooling

2. **Security Enhancements**

   - Container isolation
   - Fine-grained permissions
   - Audit logging

3. **Monitoring**

   - Performance metrics
   - Usage analytics
   - Error tracking

4. **AI Improvements**
   - Model fine-tuning
   - Context optimization
   - Tool learning
