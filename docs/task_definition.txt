take in a single task to complete, acceptance criteria for the task, and a repository url. in this order: fork the repo, design a solution to accomplish  the task, write tests to make sure the acceptance criteria are met, write the initial implementation, test the implementation against the acceptance criteria, make adjustments to deal with any failing tests, repeat until all tests pass, sync the fork if necessary, resolve any merge conflicts, update the implementation if any tests are now failing, repeat until the fork does not need to be synced, submit a PR. make a commit after every code change
