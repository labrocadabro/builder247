# Solution Design Guide

This guide outlines how to approach designing solutions for implementation tasks.

## Initial Analysis

### 1. Requirement Analysis

- Break down the task into clear, actionable components
- Identify core functionality vs optional features
- Map dependencies between components
- Note any performance or scalability requirements
- Document security considerations

### 2. Codebase Review

- Analyze the existing codebase structure
- Identify relevant existing components
- Note coding patterns and conventions
- Review existing documentation
- Check for similar implementations

### 3. Technical Constraints

- List framework/language constraints
- Note performance requirements
- Consider security requirements
- Document compatibility needs
- Review resource limitations

## Design Process

### 1. Architecture Planning

- Choose appropriate design patterns
- Plan component interactions
- Design data structures
- Define interfaces
- Consider error handling

### 2. Technology Selection

- Evaluate existing dependencies
- Consider new library needs
- Check version compatibility
- Assess security implications
- Review documentation quality

### 3. Implementation Strategy

- Break down into manageable chunks
- Prioritize core functionality
- Plan incremental delivery
- Design for testability
- Consider future maintenance

## Design Documentation

### 1. Solution Overview

Document the following:

- High-level architecture
- Component interactions
- Data flow diagrams
- Security considerations
- Performance expectations

### 2. Technical Details

Include:

- Class/function specifications
- API endpoints
- Database schemas
- Security measures
- Error handling approaches

### 3. Implementation Plan

Outline:

- Development phases
- Test strategy
- Deployment considerations
- Rollback procedures
- Monitoring needs

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Organization

- Follow project structure
- Use consistent naming
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Document public interfaces
- Include inline documentation

### 2. Security Considerations

- Follow security best practices
- Plan input validation
- Design access controls
- Consider data protection
- Plan error handling

### 3. Performance Planning

- Consider scalability
- Plan resource usage
- Design caching strategy
- Consider concurrency
- Plan monitoring points

## Important Notes for the LLM

1. Always start with thorough requirement analysis
2. Consider maintainability in design decisions
3. Design with testing in mind
4. Document design decisions and rationale
5. Consider security implications early
6. Plan for future extensibility
