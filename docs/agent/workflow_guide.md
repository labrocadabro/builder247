# Workflow Guide

This guide outlines the overall process for implementing tasks and how to transition between different phases.

## Task Flow

### 1. Initial Setup

1. Fork repository
2. Clone locally
3. Create working branch
4. Setup development environment
5. Review requirements

### 2. Design Phase

1. Read design_guide.md
2. Analyze requirements
3. Create solution design
4. Document approach
5. Plan implementation

### 3. Implementation Phase

1. Read implementation_guide.md
2. Follow implementation plan
3. Write code incrementally
4. Document as you go
5. Commit regularly

### 4. Testing Phase

1. Read testing_guide.md
2. Write tests for criteria
3. Run test suite
4. Fix failures
5. Document test coverage

### 5. PR Phase

1. Read pr_guide.md
2. Sync with upstream
3. Resolve conflicts
4. Create pull request
5. Address feedback

## Phase Transitions

### 1. Design → Implementation

Before transitioning:

- Complete design document
- Review requirements
- Plan test strategy
- Consider security
- Note dependencies

### 2. Implementation → Testing

Before transitioning:

- Complete core functionality
- Document changes
- Basic error handling
- Initial logging
- Clean code

### 3. Testing → PR

Before transitioning:

- All tests passing
- Documentation complete
- Code reviewed
- Performance verified
- Security checked

## Quality Gates

### 1. Design Quality

Must have:

- Clear architecture
- Component diagram
- Security plan
- Test strategy
- Performance considerations

### 2. Implementation Quality

Must have:

- Clean code
- Error handling
- Documentation
- Logging
- Security measures

### 3. Testing Quality

Must have:

- Test coverage
- Edge cases
- Error scenarios
- Integration tests
- Performance tests

### 4. PR Quality

Must have:

- Clean commits
- Documentation
- Passing tests
- No conflicts
- Clear description

## Error Recovery

### 1. Design Issues

If discovered during:

- Implementation: Update design
- Testing: Review requirements
- PR: Document changes

### 2. Implementation Issues

If discovered during:

- Testing: Fix and retest
- PR review: Clean up code
- Post-merge: Create fix PR

### 3. Test Failures

When encountered:

- Analyze root cause
- Review test validity
- Fix appropriate component
- Document decision
- Rerun full suite

## Important Notes for the LLM

1. Follow guides in sequence
2. Validate each phase
3. Document decisions
4. Handle errors early
5. Maintain quality
6. Keep focused commits
7. Consider security always
